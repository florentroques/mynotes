**Eric Elliott
"You're writing the wrong thing if you're writing the implementation first"  
"Important to write tests first, so they fail"**  
Tools: Behavioral BDD (he hates those) -> tends to make tests too verbose  
best tests are quality checks -> really simple to read and write  
-> **very best tests are just equality tests**    
test code should be very  
uses Tape as a tool  
-> favors test tools which are dead simple  
all he cares about, did my tests pass?  

Why Node js so popular?  
ex: ruby tests 1hour!! in JS 3 min...  
it's asynchronous by default  

Use Promises  
non-blocking default way to make things in Node  
-> guaranteed to have API non-blocking, no problem waiting on disk read  

Express is not the only way -> recommends cause it's minimal and prefers to build on top of it  
Kapi, Sails (ruby on rails like)

**Optimization:  
Start with page load, make the page visible as quick as possible, that's the key to success, best thing  
App startup  **

According to Harvard Business School, “Distributed teams tend to develop more modular products.”*

**Lobby for remote work, more remote friendly culture  
remote work culture really important  **
